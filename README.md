# PhotoViewer
A GUI that can display some pictures in a slideshow format.

This is a high school project that displays pictures to act similar to a slideshow.

Users can add their own pictures into the Images folder and run the program.
There are already sample pictures.

The runnable jar file displays the sample pictures.

The program allows users to generate ratings for the pictures. Statistics will then be generated and displayed in the stats page.
The program keeps track of how many times a picture was like or disliked.
